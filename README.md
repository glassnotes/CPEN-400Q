# CPEN 400Q: Gate-model quantum computing (UBC ECE, January 2025)

Note: starting in Fall 2025, CPEN 400Q is renamed to CPEN 416. Materials for subsequent versions of course can be found in the [new GitHub repository](https://github.com/glassnotes/CPEN-416/).

Lecture notes and in-class demos for the undergraduate course in gate-model quantum computing with [PennyLane](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/) at UBC. 

These materials are open source and free for anyone to use and adapt as they
wish.
